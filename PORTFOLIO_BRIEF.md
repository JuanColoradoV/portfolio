## 2. Personal Brand

### Tagline (choose one)

1. **"Designing clarity for complex systems."**
2. **"From research to production — I design AI and enterprise products that perform."**
3. **"Where AI meets usability. Where data meets decisions."**

### Hero Bio (homepage — 2-3 lines max)

> Senior Product Designer with 10+ years architecting B2B platforms, AI products, and enterprise dashboards. I transform complex workflows into clear, data-validated interfaces — and I bridge the gap between design and engineering because I speak both languages.

### Extended Bio (About page)

> I specialize in making complex systems usable. Over the past decade, I have led design for enterprise platforms built on SAP Fiori, AI-powered products processing real-time computer vision data, and marketing technology systems serving Fortune 500 brands.
>
> My work is defined by three principles: **validate early**, **systematize everything**, and **ship with intent**.
>
> At Solving AI, I established an evidence-based design culture — implementing Maze A/B testing workflows that improved task comprehension by ~80% and directly influenced product roadmap decisions. At CodeBranch, I redesigned Nvidia's supply chain intelligence platform from a flat, unstructured interface into a structured SAP Fiori dashboard, resulting in a ~90% usability improvement across global teams.
>
> What differentiates me from most product designers: I code. I have shipped 20+ production web templates in HTML/CSS/JS for brands including DISH, Nvidia, Milwaukee Tools, and Andersen Windows. I think in components. My designs are engineerable from day one — and I currently function as a Product Owner alongside my design role, writing user stories, overseeing QA, and ensuring design intent survives implementation.
>
> I have led and mentored design teams across 3 simultaneous B2B accounts, governed design system adoption at scale, and simplified multi-step AI interactions to meet WCAG accessibility standards. I bring the strategic perspective of a lead and the craft precision of a hands-on senior.

### Design Philosophy

> **"Evidence over opinion. Systems over one-offs. Clarity over decoration."**
>
> The best design decisions are the ones you can defend with data. I use A/B testing, user research, and analytics to drive product direction — not personal taste. I believe design systems are governance frameworks, not just component libraries. And I believe that if a user has to think about how to use your interface, you have not done your job.

## 4. Current Behance Evaluation

### Profile Overview

- **Projects:** 12 total
- **Total Views:** 1,232
- **Appreciations:** 98
- **Followers:** 37

### Project-by-Project Assessment

| Project | Views | Apprec. | Rating | Core Issue |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Chatbot AI for Canvas Builder | 101 | 1 | 2/10 | Single image upload, zero narrative, no process |
| AI-Powered Blueprint Generation | 44 | 1 | 4/10 | Narrative mismatch (says "architectural" but shows marketing tool), generic AI-written copy, typo ("whatching") |
| UX/UI: Website InvolveHub | 84 | 8 | 4/10 | No text, no process documentation, dead link, Spanish description on English platform |
| UI/UX SampleCo Landing Pages | 70 | 6 | — | Visual-only presentation |
| Generac Landing Pages Redesign | 49 | 2 | — | Visual-only presentation |
| UI/UX LMS Project | 61 | 3 | 4/10 | Minimal text (2 sentences), wireframes shown after hi-fi (wrong order), typos in links |
| Mohawk Landing Pages | 21 | 3 | — | Visual-only presentation |

| Benjamin Moore Landing Pages | 40 | 3 | — | Visual-only presentation |
| Allegion Mock Design | 23 | 2 | — | Visual-only presentation |
| UX/UI: CodeBranch Website | 21 | 1 | — | Visual-only presentation |
| Doodle it in Bellas Artes! | 366 | 36 | — | Illustration — highest engagement by far but unrelated to UX role |

### Diagnosis

**The work is strong. The presentation is not.** The core issues across all projects:

1. **No storytelling** — Projects are image dumps without narrative, context, or design rationale
2. **No process artifacts** — No wireframes, flows, research findings, or iterations shown (except LMS, partially)
3. **No metrics or outcomes** — Despite the CV having outstanding numbers (~90%, ~80%, ~30%), none appear on Behance
4. **Generic or missing copy** — Descriptions are either absent, one sentence in Spanish, or AI-generated corporate filler
5. **Single-image uploads** — Multiple projects are literally one image with zero modules
6. **Missing the projects that matter most** — Nvidia, Solving AI, and YMA/Smartel are not on Behance at all

### Transformation Priority

```
CRITICAL (do first):
  → Add Solving AI as a full case study
  → Add Nvidia (NDA-adapted) as a full case study
  → Add YMA/Smartel as a full case study

HIGH (do second):
  → Completely rebuild AI-Powered Blueprint Generation (Bucket.io)
  → Rebuild Chatbot AI for Canvas Builder
  → Rebuild InvolveHub with English narrative

MEDIUM (do third):
  → Curate the landing page projects into one "SproutLoud" mega-case-study

LOW (consider removing):
  → Doodle it in Bellas Artes! (not aligned with Senior Product Designer positioning)
  → Individual landing pages without narrative (Mohawk, USCellular, Allegion, Benjamin Moore)
```

## Case Study 1: Solving AI — Building a Validation Culture for AI Products

**PRIORITY: LEAD WITH THIS PROJECT**

> *This is your strongest portfolio piece because: (a) no NDA restrictions, (b) demonstrates the rarest skills (A/B testing culture, design system architecture, WCAG for AI), and (c) has the hardest metrics.*

---

### Metadata

| | |
|---|---|
| **Company** | Solving AI |
| **Role** | Senior Lead UX/UI Designer |
| **Duration** | Jun 2024 – Jun 2025 (1 year) |
| **Team** | Product team, engineering |
| **Tools** | Figma (Variables + Auto Layout), Maze, WCAG auditing tools |

---

### Section 1: The Challenge

**Heading:** "AI products fail when users cannot understand them."

**Copy:**

> Solving AI was building intelligent automation tools for both technical and non-technical users. The product featured multi-step AI interactions — complex workflows where users configured, triggered, and interpreted AI-generated outputs.
>
> The problem was twofold:
>
> **1. Comprehension failure.** Users struggled to understand what the AI was doing, what inputs it needed, and how to interpret its results. Task comprehension was low, and users abandoned workflows mid-process.
>
> **2. Decision-making without evidence.** Design decisions were driven by internal opinions rather than user behavior. There was no systematic way to validate whether a design change actually improved the experience.
>
> I was brought in to solve both: make the AI interactions understandable, and build the infrastructure to prove it.

**Visual to include:** Screenshot or diagram showing the complexity of the original multi-step AI flow.

---

### Section 2: Discovery & Approach

**Heading:** "Before redesigning anything, I built the system to measure it."

**Copy:**

> My first initiative was not a redesign — it was a research infrastructure.
>
> **Establishing A/B testing workflows:** I implemented Maze-based A/B testing with defined user cohorts. Each cohort represented a distinct user segment (technical vs. non-technical, new vs. returning). This gave us statistically meaningful data on how different user types experienced the same flows.
>
> **Mapping the failure points:** Through task analysis and session data, I identified the specific steps in the AI workflow where users dropped off, hesitated, or made errors. The highest friction was in the "configuration" and "results interpretation" phases.
>
> **Accessibility audit:** I conducted a WCAG compliance assessment across the product. AI products disproportionately exclude users with disabilities — especially in data visualization and error communication. I mapped every violation and prioritized fixes by user impact.

**Visuals to include:**
- Maze test setup screenshot (cohort definitions, test structure)
- User flow diagram annotated with drop-off rates
- WCAG audit findings summary

---

### Section 3: Design Decisions

**Heading:** "Simplifying AI without dumbing it down."

**Copy:**

> The core design challenge: how do you make a multi-step AI workflow accessible to non-technical users without removing the power that technical users need?
>
> **Progressive disclosure for AI configuration.** I restructured the configuration flow so that basic settings were front and center, while advanced parameters were accessible but not overwhelming. This reduced cognitive load for new users while preserving flexibility for power users.
>
> **Transparent AI feedback.** Instead of treating AI processing as a black box, I designed inline progress indicators, confidence scores, and natural-language explanations of what the AI was doing at each step. Users could see *why* the AI made a recommendation, not just *what* it recommended.
>
> **Accessible data visualization.** I redesigned charts and outputs to meet WCAG AA standards — adding text alternatives, keyboard navigation for interactive elements, sufficient color contrast, and screen-reader-compatible data tables alongside visual representations.

**Visuals to include:**
- Before/after of the AI configuration flow
- Progressive disclosure interaction pattern
- Accessible data visualization components
- WCAG-compliant color and contrast samples

---

### Section 4: Design System

**Heading:** "A system designed to scale — not just to look consistent."

**Copy:**

> I architected a scalable Figma design system built on three pillars:
>
> **Figma Variables** — Design tokens for color, spacing, typography, and elevation, enabling theme switching and systematic updates across the entire product.
>
> **Auto Layout architecture** — Every component built with responsive Auto Layout, ensuring consistent behavior across breakpoints without manual adjustment.
>
> **Atomic Design methodology** — Atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages — each level documented with usage guidelines, interaction states, and engineering specifications.
>
> The result: design-to-dev handoff time decreased by ~30%. Engineers could inspect components and extract specifications without requiring designer clarification on every screen.

**Visuals to include:**
- Design system structure overview (token hierarchy)
- Component library (key components with states)
- Figma Variables panel screenshot
- Before/after handoff workflow

---

### Section 5: Validation & Results

**Heading:** "The numbers that changed the roadmap."

**Copy:**

> This is where the investment in testing infrastructure paid off:
>
> **~80% improvement in task comprehension.** A/B tests comparing the original flows against the redesigned versions showed a dramatic increase in users successfully completing AI configuration and correctly interpreting results. This was measured across both technical and non-technical cohorts.
>
> **~30% reduction in design-to-dev handoff time.** The design system eliminated ambiguity in specifications. Engineers reported fewer clarification requests, and the team shipped features faster without sacrificing design fidelity.
>
> **Reduced churn.** Users who previously abandoned multi-step workflows began completing them. Product analytics showed improved retention in the AI workflow funnel, directly influencing roadmap priorities toward further AI UX investment.
>
> **WCAG AA compliance achieved.** The product passed accessibility audits for all critical user flows, expanding the addressable user base and meeting enterprise procurement requirements.

**Visuals to include:**
- Metric comparison cards (before/after): Task comprehension, handoff time, completion rates
- A/B test result visualization from Maze
- Accessibility compliance checklist (pass/fail visual)

---

### Section 6: Reflection

**Copy:**

> If I could do this project again, I would push for quantitative baseline metrics *before* starting the redesign. We measured improvement, but our "before" data was partially reconstructed from session recordings rather than controlled baseline tests. Starting every project with a measurable benchmark is now a non-negotiable in my process.
>
> This project fundamentally shaped how I approach design: not as an aesthetic exercise, but as a hypothesis to be validated.

## Case Study 2: Nvidia Supply Chain Intelligence Platform [NDA-Adapted]

**PRIORITY: HIGH — The brand name alone commands attention**

---

### NDA Strategy

Since you cannot show Nvidia's actual interface, here is the approach:

```
WHAT YOU CAN SHOW:                          WHAT YOU CANNOT SHOW:
─────────────────────────────                ─────────────────────────────
✓ Your design process                       ✗ Final production screens
✓ Generic wireframes (redacted)             ✗ Nvidia branding / data
✓ Information architecture diagrams         ✗ Specific feature names
✓ Design system components (generic)        ✗ Internal dashboards
✓ User flow diagrams (anonymized)           ✗ User research with Nvidia employees
✓ Your role & responsibilities              ✗ Proprietary AI/ML features
✓ SAP Fiori methodology explanation         ✗ Screenshots of the live platform
✓ Metrics (if approved by client)
✓ Component library (with neutral content)
✓ Annotated wireframes explaining decisions
```

**Recommended visual approach:**
1. Use **redacted wireframes** — show the structure with placeholder/blurred content
2. Create **custom diagrams** explaining your IA and flow decisions
3. Show **generic design system components** without Nvidia-specific branding
4. Use **annotated process diagrams** that explain your decisions without revealing proprietary interfaces
5. Include a clear **"This project is under NDA"** badge — it signals professionalism, not weakness

| **Tools** | Figma, SAP Fiori, Atomic Design |
| **NDA** | Active — visuals are anonymized/redacted |

---

### Section 1: The Challenge

**Heading:** "Redesigning decision-making for a global supply chain."

**Copy:**

> I led the UX redesign of a supply chain intelligence platform for one of the world's largest technology companies. The platform served global supply chain teams who needed to make high-stakes operational decisions based on AI-generated insights and real-time data.
>
> The existing interface was flat and unstructured — information was presented without hierarchy, forcing users to mentally organize data before they could act on it. This slowed decision-making and increased error rates, particularly for cross-functional teams who needed different views of the same data.
>
> My mandate: restructure the platform into a clear, decision-oriented dashboard that enables faster, more confident action — while scaling the design to support a growing AI feature set.

*Note: This project is under NDA. Visuals are redacted or recreated to illustrate process without revealing proprietary interfaces.*

---

### Section 2: Approach

**Heading:** "Bringing enterprise structure to AI-powered complexity."

**Copy:**

> **SAP Fiori as the structural foundation.** I chose SAP Fiori as the design framework for two reasons: it is the enterprise standard that supply chain teams already understand, and its structured dashboard patterns (Overview Pages, Object Pages, List Reports) map directly to supply chain decision-making workflows.
>
> **Information architecture overhaul.** I restructured the platform's IA from a flat list of features into a task-oriented hierarchy. Users no longer navigated by feature name — they navigated by decision type: "What needs my attention?", "What is the current status?", "What action should I take?"
>
> **AI integration patterns.** I designed interaction patterns for AI-generated recommendations that maintained user agency. The AI surfaced insights, but humans made the final decisions — with clear confidence indicators and the ability to drill into the underlying data.
>
> **Design system governance.** I established a component library built on Atomic Design principles, enabling 2 junior designers to contribute to the system without architectural drift. I governed adoption through documentation, review processes, and weekly design critiques.

**Visuals to include:**
- Redacted wireframe showing the dashboard structure (blurred content, visible layout)
- IA diagram: flat structure vs. task-oriented hierarchy
- SAP Fiori pattern selection rationale (annotated)
- Design system governance workflow diagram
- Mentoring structure (how junior designers contributed)

---

### Section 3: My Role Beyond Design

**Heading:** "Functional Product Owner — bridging design intent and engineering execution."

**Copy:**

> On this project, I operate beyond the traditional designer scope. As a functional Product Owner, I:
>
> - **Author user stories** with acceptance criteria, ensuring engineering teams understand the *intent* behind each design decision, not just the pixel specifications
> - **Conduct QA oversight** — reviewing implemented features against design specifications and user story requirements
> - **Facilitate design-engineering alignment** — weekly syncs with 5+ engineers including AI/ML specialists to resolve technical constraints and negotiate design trade-offs
> - **Govern the design system** — maintaining component documentation, reviewing PRs that affect UI consistency, and ensuring Atomic Design compliance across the product

---

### Section 4: Impact

**Heading:** "Measurable transformation."

**Copy:**

> - **~90% usability improvement** — measured through structured usability assessments comparing the original interface against the redesigned SAP Fiori dashboard
> - **Faster decision-making** — supply chain teams reported significantly reduced time-to-action on critical operational decisions
> - **Scalable design foundation** — the component library and design system I established now supports the full product team, with 2 junior designers contributing independently
> - **Cross-functional alignment** — structured user stories and QA processes reduced design-to-engineering misinterpretation

## Case Study 3: YMA / Smartel — Designing an AI Ecosystem from Zero

**PRIORITY: HIGH — Demonstrates 0→1 product thinking**

---

### Metadata

| | |
|---|---|
| **Company** | CodeBranch (product: YMA / Smartel) |
| **Role** | Senior Lead UX/UI Designer + Functional Product Owner |
| **Duration** | Jun 2025 – Present |
| **Team** | 5+ engineers, 2 junior designers |
| **Tools** | Figma, Computer Vision UI patterns, Mobile-first design |

---

### Section 1: The Challenge

**Heading:** "Building the foundational experience for an AI ecosystem — with no precedent to follow."

**Copy:**

> YMA is part of the Smartel AI ecosystem — a product suite powered by computer vision and real-time data processing. When I joined, there was no established product experience: no design patterns, no component library, no interaction conventions.
>
> The challenge was threefold:
>
> **1. Designing for real-time AI data.** Computer vision generates continuous, high-frequency output — confidence scores, object detection results, threshold alerts. The interface needed to communicate this data clearly without overwhelming users or introducing latency-induced confusion.
>
> **2. Mobile-first for field use.** The primary users interact with the system on mobile devices in real-world environments. Every interaction pattern had to work reliably on small screens, in variable lighting, with one-handed operation.
>
> **3. Scaling design through other designers.** I was the only senior designer. The system needed to be so well-structured that 2 junior designers could extend it across the entire product suite without my direct involvement on every screen.

---

### Section 2: Design Decisions

**Heading:** "Real-time data, mobile-first, built to scale."

**Copy:**

> **Real-time feedback architecture.** I designed a feedback loop system where computer vision results are presented as progressive updates rather than single-state outputs. Users see confidence scores evolving in real time, with clear visual thresholds distinguishing "processing," "low confidence," and "confirmed" states.
>
> **Mobile-first component system.** Every component was designed mobile-first and scaled up to tablet/desktop — not the other way around. Touch targets, information density, and navigation patterns were all optimized for one-handed mobile use before being adapted for larger viewports.
>
> **Scalable design library.** I created a component library with comprehensive documentation: usage guidelines, interaction states, responsive behavior, and engineering annotations. This enabled the 2 junior designers to work autonomously across the product suite while maintaining design consistency.

**Visuals to include:**
- Mobile UI showing real-time computer vision feedback
- Component library overview with documentation
- Responsive behavior (mobile → tablet → desktop)
- Design system adoption metrics (junior designer output consistency)

---

### Section 3: Impact

> - **Foundational design system** adopted across the entire Smartel product suite
> - **2 junior designers** enabled to contribute independently through comprehensive documentation and governance
> - **Mobile-first architecture** validated through field testing
> - **Real-time feedback patterns** successfully communicating computer vision data without user confusion

## Case Study 4: Bucket.io — AI-Powered Blueprint Generation

**PRIORITY: MEDIUM — Shows AI product design for a specific vertical**

> *This replaces the current Behance project "AI-Powered Blueprint Generation." The existing Behance presentation must be completely rebuilt.*

---

### Metadata

| | |
|---|---|
| **Company** | Ideaware (client: Bucket.io) |
| **Role** | UX/UI Senior Designer |
| **Duration** | Sep 2023 – May 2024 |
| **Team** | Product + engineering team |
| **Tools** | Figma, Interactive Prototyping |

---

### Section 1: The Challenge

**Heading:** "Making AI-generated content creation accessible to non-technical marketers."

**Copy:**

> Bucket.io needed to transform its blueprint generation system — a tool that uses AI to automatically create marketing documents (webinar outlines, enrollment scripts, attraction funnels) based on user inputs.
>
> The existing workflow required users to navigate a multi-step configuration process that was confusing, particularly for users without technical backgrounds. Drop-off rates were high in the middle of the funnel, and users frequently misconfigured parameters that led to poor AI output quality.
>
> My objective: redesign the end-to-end blueprint generation flow so that users of any technical level could successfully create high-quality, AI-generated marketing documents.

---

### Section 2: Process

**Heading:** "Journey mapping to find the friction. Prototypes to prove the fix."

**Copy:**

> **Journey mapping:** I mapped the complete user journey from "I need a marketing document" to "I have a polished, ready-to-use blueprint." This revealed three critical friction points: blueprint selection (too many options, no guidance), question configuration (unclear what each parameter affected), and result interpretation (no way to refine output without starting over).
>
> **Wireframing the funnel:** I restructured the flow as a guided funnel with clear progress indication. Each step had a single focus: select blueprint type → answer guided questions (1 through 5) → review AI-generated result → refine or regenerate.
>
> **Interactive prototyping for validation:** Before any engineering investment, I delivered high-fidelity interactive prototypes that stakeholders could test with real user scenarios. This accelerated alignment and saved weeks of potential engineering rework.

**Visuals to include:**
- Journey map showing the full user flow
- Wireframes of the guided funnel (step-by-step)
- Component library cards (forms, progress indicators, result displays)
- Final UI options (Option 1 vs Option 2 — show the exploration)
- Device mockups in context

---

### Section 3: Impact

> - **Stakeholder alignment achieved** before engineering investment through prototype-driven validation
> - **Guided funnel** replaced the unstructured flow, reducing configuration errors
> - **Two design options delivered** — giving the product team flexibility in implementation approach
> - **AI output quality improved** indirectly — better user configuration led to better AI inputs

| **Tools** | HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Figma, Photoshop, Illustrator |

---

### Narrative Approach

> This case study is structured differently from the others — it is a **career growth narrative** rather than a single project deep-dive. It demonstrates three things hiring managers value: **longevity**, **growth trajectory**, and **the rare designer-who-codes profile**.

**Heading:** "From production designer to engineering: 7 years designing and building for America's biggest brands."

**Copy:**

> Over 7 years at SproutLoud, I grew from production designer to team lead to web developer — each promotion earned through consistent delivery, ownership, and expanding capability.
>
> **The work:** 20+ customizable web templates serving national brands through SproutLoud's distributed marketing platform. Each template had to balance brand consistency (rigid guidelines from DISH, Milwaukee Tools, etc.) with local customization (franchisees needed to personalize content without breaking the design).
>
> **The dual skill:** I designed and coded every template — from UI concept in Figma/Photoshop to responsive HTML/CSS/JS implementation. Cross-browser compatibility, responsive breakpoints, and email client rendering were daily engineering challenges, not theoretical concerns.
>
> **The leadership:** As Team Lead, I managed the production design team, oversaw digital and print campaigns (~50% print), and established the design-to-code pipeline that the team used after my transition to full web development.

**Visuals to include:**
- Grid of client logos (DISH, Nvidia, Milwaukee Tools, Andersen Windows, Generac, Benjamin Moore, etc.)
- 3-4 template examples showing responsive behavior
- Career progression timeline at SproutLoud
- Code snippet showing clean, maintainable CSS

# PART 4: PORTFOLIO UX & VISUAL GUIDELINES

---

## 5. The Portfolio Is Your First Case Study

Hiring managers will judge your design skills by the portfolio's own UX.

### Performance

- Load time under 2 seconds (optimize images aggressively — WebP, lazy loading)
- No full-page loaders or splash screens
- Works offline for critical pages (PWA optional but impressive)

### Accessibility (non-negotiable — you list WCAG on your CV)

- WCAG AA minimum across all pages
- Keyboard navigable (tab order, focus states, skip links)
- Screen-reader-compatible navigation and content
- Sufficient color contrast ratios
- Alt text on every image

### Responsive

- Mobile-first design (many recruiters review portfolios on phones)
- Flawless on iPhone SE through 27" desktop
- Touch-friendly tap targets on mobile

### Typography

- Primary: Clean sans-serif (Inter, Satoshi, or General Sans)
- Body: 16–18px, line-height 1.5–1.6
- Headings: Bold weight, generous scale (48 / 36 / 28 / 20)
- Monospace accent for metrics and data points (reinforces the data-driven narrative)

### Color

- Neutral base: near-black text (#1a1a1a) on warm white (#fafaf8)
- One accent color used sparingly — for CTAs, metric callouts, and interactive states
- Let project visuals carry the visual weight; the portfolio frame stays quiet

### Layout

- Max content width: ~1200px
- Case study images: full-bleed or constrained with generous padding (40–80px)
- 8px grid system
- Sticky navigation (minimal, not obtrusive)
- Generous whitespace between sections (80–120px)

## 8. Assets to Gather

### Solving AI (highest priority — no NDA restrictions)

- [ ] Maze A/B test setup screenshots
- [ ] Maze test results (before/after)
- [ ] AI workflow flow diagrams (before and after redesign)
- [ ] Design system screenshots (Figma Variables, component library)
- [ ] WCAG audit documentation / findings
- [ ] Handoff workflow comparison
- [ ] Any analytics showing improved completion/retention

### Nvidia Supply Chain (NDA-adapted)

- [ ] Redacted wireframes (blur proprietary content, keep structural layout visible)
- [ ] Information architecture diagram (anonymized labels)
- [ ] Design system components (with neutral/generic content)
- [ ] User flow diagrams (anonymized)
- [ ] SAP Fiori pattern documentation you created
- [ ] Mentoring/governance workflow diagrams (these are your process, not Nvidia's IP)

### YMA / Smartel

- [ ] Mobile UI screenshots (computer vision feedback states)
- [ ] Component library overview
- [ ] Responsive behavior demonstrations (mobile → tablet → desktop)
- [ ] Design system documentation pages
- [ ] Real-time feedback pattern examples

### Bucket.io / AI Blueprint Generation

- [ ] Journey map
- [ ] Wireframes of the guided funnel
- [ ] Component library cards
- [ ] Final UI screens (Option 1 and Option 2)
- [ ] Device mockups
- [ ] Remove/rewrite any text that says "architectural blueprints" — the product generates marketing documents

### SproutLoud (optional)

- [ ] 3-4 best template examples (responsive)
- [ ] Client logos (DISH, Nvidia, Milwaukee Tools, etc.)
- [ ] Career timeline graphic

### General

- [ ] Professional headshot

## 9. Behance Rebuild Checklist

For each project on Behance, apply this transformation:

- [ ] **Add 8–15 Behance modules** per project (mix of image + text blocks)
- [ ] **Write an English project description** (2-3 sentences minimum)
- [ ] **Add text modules between images** narrating the design story
- [ ] **Include process artifacts** (wireframes, flows, research)
- [ ] **Add metric callouts** as standalone visual modules
- [ ] **Use device mockups** for all final UI presentations
- [ ] **Fix all typos** ("whatching" → "watching", missing "link" words in LMS)
- [ ] **Remove or restructure** the narrative mismatch in Blueprint Generation
- [ ] **Add descriptive alt text** to every image (not just keyword stuffing)
- [ ] **Include Figma prototype links** where available

# PART 7: ACTION PLAN

---

## 10. Execution Roadmap

### Phase 1: Content Gathering (Week 1-2)

1. Export/screenshot all process artifacts from Figma files
2. Gather Maze A/B test results from Solving AI
3. Create redacted wireframes for Nvidia project
4. Collect client logos and permissions
5. Take professional headshot if needed

### Phase 2: Case Study Writing (Week 2-3)

1. Use the copy drafts in this document as your starting point
2. Refine with real project details and accurate metrics
3. Have a colleague or mentor review for clarity and tone
4. Ensure all verbiage reads "Senior/Lead" — no junior language

### Phase 3: Behance Rebuild (Week 3-4)

1. Rebuild the 3 critical projects first (Solving AI, Nvidia, YMA)
2. Then rebuild Bucket.io / Blueprint Generation
3. Curate or remove the visual-only landing page projects
4. Test on mobile and desktop

### Phase 4: Portfolio Website (Week 4-6)

1. Design in Figma (using your own design system principles)
2. Build on Framer, Next.js, or Astro (your call — you code, so custom is an option)
3. Implement SEO, accessibility, performance optimizations
4. Launch, test, iterate based on peer feedback

### Phase 5: Launch (Week 6+)

1. Update LinkedIn with portfolio link
2. Update Behance profile link
3. Share selectively with target companies/recruiters
4. Monitor analytics (which case studies get the most engagement?)

| "I made the UI better" | "I restructured the interface to improve usability by ~90%" |
| "I worked with developers" | "I facilitated design-engineering alignment across 5+ engineers" |
| "I did user research" | "I established a validation culture using A/B testing with defined user cohorts" |
| "I created a design system" | "I architected and governed a scalable design system using Atomic Design principles" |
| "I helped the team" | "I mentored 2 junior designers, enabling autonomous contribution to the product suite" |
| "We tested it and it was good" | "A/B testing demonstrated an ~80% improvement in task comprehension" |
| "I made it accessible" | "I ensured WCAG AA compliance across all critical user flows" |
| "I was involved in the project" | "I owned the end-to-end design strategy, from research through production QA" |
| "It was a fun project" | "This engagement fundamentally shaped my approach to evidence-based design" |
